#Mapty Workout Application

This project was built following the instructions of Jonas Schedtmann, a Udemy JavaScript course instructor. It simulates a banking application and relies heavily on the use of arrays and array methods.

There is a flowchart provided with this project which provides an abstract look at the overall build and functionality. --> Bankist-flowchart.png

There are four accounts that can be logged-in/out with different pins and usernames given here:

account 1 user name = js *account 1 pin: 1111
account 2 user name = jd *account 2 pin: 2222
account 3 user name = sw *account 3 pin: 3333
account 4 user name = ss *account 4 pin: 4444
Constructing this project helped me to better learn and practice the following:

insertAdjacentHTML() method and properties (beforebegin, afterbegin, beforeend, afterend).
Multiple Array.methods()
.blur() method
DOM manipulation
! operator
\_ for omitting parameters
Working with Dates and Numbers
Internationalizing
setTimeout()
Creating a Countdown Timer
A general walkthrough of the JavaScript code is given below.
